# Owner Avatar - PySpark_SQL_CICD

Welcome to the **Owner Avatar - PySpark_SQL_CICD** repository. This project is designed to manage data processing workflows using **PySpark** with a focus on **ETL pipelines** and **Data Quality Checks**, implemented with a **CI/CD** approach.

---

## 🚀 Project Structure

The project consists of two primary repositories:

### 📦 ETL_Pipeline1
This repository contains the core ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built with **PySpark** and **SQL**. It automates data extraction from source systems, transformation using Spark SQL, and loading into target data warehouses or databases.

- **Key Features:**
  - Data extraction from various sources
  - Data transformation with PySpark SQL
  - Scheduling and automation of ETL jobs

### 📊 DataQuality_Checks
This repository ensures data integrity, accuracy, and reliability. It includes scripts and tools to perform automated **data quality checks** on processed datasets.

- **Key Features:**
  - Validation of data against business rules
  - Data profiling and anomaly detection
  - Reporting and alerting for data issues

---

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

The project integrates a robust **CI/CD pipeline** to automate the testing, deployment, and monitoring of ETL jobs and data quality checks.

- **Technologies Used:**
  - **Apache Spark** (PySpark & SQL)
  - **Jenkins/GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation
  - **Docker** (if applicable) for containerization
  - **Airflow** (optional) for workflow orchestration

---
